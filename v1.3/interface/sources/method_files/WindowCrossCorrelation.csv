Parameter_description,the maximum lag at which correlation should be computed. It is in the range [0; (self.lx+self.ly-1)/2] (in samples),if True the plot of correlation function is showed. Default: False,length of the windowed signals (in samples),amount of time elapsed between two windows (in samples),amount of time elapsed between two cross-correlation (in samples),number of element in one second,
