Introduction
------------

    **SyncPy** is a novel open-source analytic library for investigating synchrony in a fast and exhaustive way. It stems from work and discussions among
    researchers on synchrony in different domains as engineering, computer science and psychology. SyncPy is mainly aimed at helping researchers to explore, 
    try and compare in an easy way and with a single tool synchrony methods starting from signals. Signals are synthetic or experimental time series 
    organized as *pandas DataFrames*.
 
    The library has been conceived to investigate synchrony in human-human/human machine interaction, however, although it focuses on *interpersonal synchrony*, 
    all the methods are exploitable in other contexts.

    SyncPy functionalities include three main components:
    
    1. utils package
    2. graphical interface
    3. synchrony methods package

    The utils package contains functionals of general utility directly used by the synchrony methods or to preprocess the input signals. All the 
    functionals are described in the Section 3.3 of this document. 

    The graphical interface is a pyQT application conceived to assist users to choose and try several methods. More sepcifically, it allows users to:
    
    1. load time series from files
    2. visualize/modify these time series through the utils
    3. choose a consistent method according to the data set 
    4. compute the selected method and 
    5. visualize and/or save the result in a file (.csv format).

    The synchrony methods package will be described in details in the Section 3.2 of this document. 

    SyncPy library is currently under development in the framework of the SMART Labex Project (`smart-labex`_)
