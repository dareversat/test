Name,,,,,,Correlation
Description,,,,,,Computes the linear correlation between two monovariate times series x and y (in DataFrame format) as a function of their delay tau. Computes autocorrelation when y coincides with x.

Parameter_description,the maximum lag at which correlation should be computed. It is in the range [0; (self.lx+self.ly-1)/2] (in samples),if True the plot of correlation function is showed. Default: False,if True the times series are standardize to mean 0 and variance 1. Default: False,if True the maximum of correlation and its lag are returned. Default: False,if True the correlation coefficient (Pearson s version) is computed. It is enabled onself.ly if the parameter standardize is True. Default: False,
