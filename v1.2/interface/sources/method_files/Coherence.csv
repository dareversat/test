Name,,,,,,Coherence
Description,,,,,,Computes the linear correlation between two monovariate time series x and y (in DataFrame format) as a function of the frequency. It is the cross-spectral density function normalized by the autospectral density function of x and y.
Type,,,,,,Linear
Data_Type,,,,,,Continuous
Signal_Type,,,,,,Univariate

Parameter_description,sampling frequency of the input DataFrame in Hz. Default: 1.0,length of each epoch. Default: 256,specifies which kind of detrending should be computed on data. Ranges in [0;1]: 0 stands for constant detrending; 1 stands for linear detrending. Default: 0,number of points to overlap between epochs. Default: 0,if True the plot of coherence function is showed. Default: False,
