Parameter_description,"{'tot', 'tsl', 'asl'}
         -- 'tot':synchronicity (Q) and time delay pattern(q) are computed over all the time series.\n
         -- 'tsl':time resolved variants of Q and q\n
         -- 'asl':averaged time resolved variants of Q and q over a window","it is in the range [0;2] indicating which type of algorithm is used to estimates the delay.
         -- 0 : a prefixed tau with value specified by lag_tau. It should be smaller than half the minimum interevent distance\n
         -- 1 : local tau for each pair of events in the series.
      The local tau for a generic pair of events i and j is computed as the half of the minimum value in the following set
      [tau_x(i+1)- tau_x(i); tau_x(i)-tau_x(i-1); tau_y(j+i)-tau_y(j), tau_y(j)-tau_y(j-1)]",it is the (positive) number of samples will be used as delay when tau is set to 0,it is the size of the window to compute Q and q when type is 'asl' (in samples).,if True the plot of Q and q is showed when type is 'tsl' or 'asl'. Default: False,
