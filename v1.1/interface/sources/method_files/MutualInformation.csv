Parameter_description,number of nearest neighbours ,Type of the estimators will be used to compute MI. Two avaialble options: 1 and 2. The estimators differ about the way the k-nearest neighbours are computed.,Boolean value indicating if the input time series should be rescaled at unitary variance.,Boolean value indicating if a very low amplitude random noise should be added to the time series. It is done to avoid that there are many time series points having identical coordinates.,
